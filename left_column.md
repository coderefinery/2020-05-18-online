### Format

Hands-on informal and interactive online event with 3 half-days
composed of type-along type of presentations, live coding and
demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises.


### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research software development. The main focus is on professional tools for efficiently writing and maintaining research software. Since most research code is developed in a collaborative setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate this process. Most of the content is also relevant to a single researcher.

This workshop does not cover the two Git lessons, [Introduction to
version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
and [Collaborative distributed version
control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/). 
**Workshop participants are expected to have attended these lessons before,**
**or have significant previous experience with Git.**

### **Software requirements**

Please follow the links below and make sure that you install all the required software packages
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation page.

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/)
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
