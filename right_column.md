### Who the course is for

Does any of the following apply you?
- You write scripts to process data (at intermediate level or higher)
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You would like to apply best software practice.

If yes, then this course is for you.  Most participants are not
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.


### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.

- Familiar with one or more programming languages.
- You can use a machine with which you can work on exercise and join in the workshop by Zoom.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links in the schedule.
